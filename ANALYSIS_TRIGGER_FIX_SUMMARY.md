# Analysis Trigger Endpoint Fix Summary

## Problem
The `/api/v1/analysis/trigger` endpoint was returning a 404 error when accessed through Netlify Dev server (localhost:8888).

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **endpoint order precedence** in the Netlify serverless function (`netlify/functions/api.ts`). The general `/analysis` endpoint was being checked BEFORE the specific `/analysis/trigger` endpoint, causing all requests to `/analysis/*` paths to be caught by the general handler.

## Solution
Reorganized the endpoint checking order in the Netlify function to ensure specific endpoints are checked before general ones:

```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect order - caused 404):
// 1. Check for /analysis (catches ALL /analysis/* paths)
// 2. Check for /analysis/trigger (never reached!)

// AFTER (correct order - fixed):
// 1. Check for /analysis/trigger (specific)
// 2. Check for /analysis/latest (specific) 
// 3. Check for /analysis/:date (specific)
// 4. Check for /analysis (general - catches remaining)
```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Moved Specific Endpoints Before General Endpoint
In `netlify/functions/api.ts`, moved the analysis trigger endpoint check (around line 1880) to come BEFORE the root analysis endpoint check (around line 1750).

### 2. Added Method-Specific Handling
```typescript
if (isAnalysisTrigger) {
  if (httpMethod === 'POST') {
    // Handle POST request
  } else {
    // Return 405 Method Not Allowed for other methods
    return {
      statusCode: 405,
      headers: { ...corsHeaders, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        success: false,
        error: 'Method not allowed. Use POST for trigger endpoint.'
      })
    };
  }
}
```

### 3. Comprehensive Path Matching
Updated path matching to handle various Netlify redirect scenarios:
```typescript
const isAnalysisTrigger = (
  apiPath === '/api/v1/analysis/trigger' ||
  apiPath === '/v1/analysis/trigger' ||  // Netlify redirect result
  apiPath === '/analysis/trigger' ||
  apiPath.endsWith('/analysis/trigger')
);
```

### 4. Removed Duplicate Endpoint Definitions
Cleaned up duplicate endpoint checks that were causing TypeScript errors.

## Testing

Created comprehensive test scripts to verify the fix:
- `test-trigger-endpoint.sh` - Quick test for the critical endpoint
- `test-analysis-endpoints-comprehensive.ts` - Full test suite for all analysis endpoints

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **POST /api/v1/analysis/trigger** - Returns 200/201 (with auth) or 401 (without auth)
2. **GET /api/v1/analysis/trigger** - Returns 405 Method Not Allowed
3. **GET /api/v1/analysis** - Returns list of analyses
4. **GET /api/v1/analysis/latest** - Returns latest analysis
5. **GET /api/v1/analysis/:date** - Returns analysis for specific date

## Important Notes

1. **Endpoint Order Matters**: In Netlify Functions, unlike Express.js, endpoint matching is done sequentially. Always place specific endpoints before general ones.

2. **Path Redirects**: Netlify's `redirects` configuration in `netlify.toml` transforms paths:
   - `/api/v1/analysis/trigger` â†’ `/v1/analysis/trigger` in the function

3. **No Express Router**: Netlify Functions don't use Express routing, so manual path matching is required.

## Verification Steps

1. Start Netlify Dev: `netlify dev`
2. Run the test script: `./test-trigger-endpoint.sh`
3. Expected result: Status 401 (needs auth) instead of 404

This fix ensures that the analysis trigger endpoint is properly served and accessible through the Netlify Dev server.
