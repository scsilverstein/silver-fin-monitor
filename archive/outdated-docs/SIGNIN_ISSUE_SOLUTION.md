# Sign-In Issue Resolution

## Current Status
- ✅ Netlify deployment is live at: https://silver-fin-monitor-prod.netlify.app
- ✅ Serverless auth function is working: https://silver-fin-monitor-prod.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/auth/health
- ❌ Frontend is still trying to connect to localhost:3001 instead of Netlify functions

## Root Cause
The frontend JavaScript bundle was built with the API URL pointing to localhost because:
1. The production detection logic isn't working correctly
2. The build had TypeScript errors which may have affected the output

## Quick Solution

### Option 1: Set Environment Variable (Recommended)
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard: https://app.netlify.com/projects/silver-fin-monitor-prod/configuration/env
2. Add: `VITE_API_URL = /.netlify/functions/auth`
3. Trigger a redeploy from the dashboard

### Option 2: Manual Fix
1. The auth endpoint is working at: `/.netlify/functions/auth`
2. Login endpoint: `/.netlify/functions/auth/login`
3. Demo credentials work: `admin@silverfin.com` / `password`

### Option 3: Use Local Development
Since the backend isn't fully deployed, you can run the app locally:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Then in another terminal:
```bash
cd ..
npm run dev
```

## Technical Details
- The serverless function at `/netlify/functions/auth.js` handles authentication
- It supports demo login with hardcoded credentials
- The frontend needs to be rebuilt with the correct API URL

## Next Steps
1. Add `VITE_API_URL` environment variable in Netlify
2. Fix TypeScript errors in the codebase
3. Deploy a proper backend API or expand serverless functions
