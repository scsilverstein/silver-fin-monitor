# Stock Market Data API Comparison

## Overview

This document compares three stock market data providers for the Silver Fin Monitor stock scanner feature.

## Provider Comparison

### 1. Polygon.io

**Pros:**
- Comprehensive real-time and historical data
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Detailed company information including SIC codes
- Good documentation and SDK support
- Reliable uptime

**Cons:**
- Limited free tier (5 requests/minute)
- Requires credit card for paid plans
- More expensive than alternatives

**Free Tier Limits:**
- 5 API calls per minute
- End-of-day data only
- 2 years of historical data

**Implementation Status:** ✅ Complete
- Server: `test-stock-server-real.js`
- Uses real-time data with proper sector mapping
- Handles rate limiting with delays

### 2. Alpha Vantage

**Pros:**
- Completely free tier available
- No credit card required for free tier
- Good coverage of fundamental data
- Simple API structure

**Cons:**
- Very restrictive rate limits (5 calls/minute on free tier)
- Limited company details (no sector information in quote endpoint)
- Slower response times
- Less comprehensive than Polygon

**Free Tier Limits:**
- 5 API calls per minute
- 500 API calls per day
- Limited endpoints on free tier

**Implementation Status:** ✅ Complete
- Server: `test-stock-server-alphavantage.js`
- Requires manual sector mapping
- Needs valid API key (demo key doesn't work)

### 3. Yahoo Finance (Unofficial)

**Pros:**
- No API key required
- No official rate limits
- Comprehensive data available
- Fast response times

**Cons:**
- Unofficial API (web scraping)
- Can break without notice
- Legal gray area for commercial use
- No guaranteed uptime

**Free Tier Limits:**
- No official limits
- Subject to IP blocking if abused

**Implementation Status:** ⚠️ Partially implemented
- Basic structure in `stock-data-fetcher.ts`
- Would need additional work to complete

## Recommendation

For the Silver Fin Monitor project, I recommend using **Polygon.io** for the following reasons:

1. **Data Quality**: Provides the most comprehensive and accurate data
2. **Reliability**: Official API with guaranteed uptime
3. **Sector Information**: Includes SIC codes for proper sector classification
4. **Already Working**: Current implementation is functional and tested

### Fallback Strategy

Implement a multi-provider fallback system:
1. Primary: Polygon.io (already implemented)
2. Fallback: Alpha Vantage (when Polygon rate limit is reached)
3. Cache Layer: Aggressive caching to minimize API calls

### Next Steps

To use Alpha Vantage as a fallback:
1. Get a free API key from https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key
2. Set environment variable: `export ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key`
3. Modify the server to use both providers with automatic fallback

## Current Implementation

The stock scanner is currently running on port 9999 with the following endpoints:

- Health Check: `http://localhost:9999/api/v1/health`
- Stock Screener: `http://localhost:9999/api/v1/stocks/screener`
- Single Quote: `http://localhost:9999/api/v1/stocks/quote/:symbol`
- Favorites: `http://localhost:9999/api/v1/stocks/favorites`

The frontend is configured to use these endpoints through the Netlify proxy redirect.
